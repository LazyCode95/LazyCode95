👋 Hi, I’m @LazyCode95

👀 I’m interested in web development, software engineering, and exploring new technologies.

🌱 I’m currently learning python and improving my skills in backend development with php yii2 framework.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I studied music for 12 years before venturing into programming! The transition was exciting, 
but I found my passion for coding and have been enjoying the journey of learning and tackling new challenges ever since.
